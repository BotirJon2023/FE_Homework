    <h1>Filmography of James Bond</h1>

    <h4>James Bond is a fictional character created by British novelist Ian Fleming in 1953. A British secret agent
        working for MI6 under the codename 007, Bond has been portrayed on film in twenty-seven productions by actors
        Sean Connery, David Niven, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig. Eon
        Productions, which now holds the adaptation rights to all of Fleming's Bond novels, made all but two films in
        the film series.</h4>

    <h3>Dr. No (1962)</h3>
    <img src="img/Dr._No_-_UK_cinema_poster.jpg" alt="">
    <p>It is the first film in the James Bond series. Starring Sean Connery, Ursula Andress, Joseph Wiseman and Jack
        Lord, it was adapted by Richard Maibaum, Johanna Harwood, and Berkely Mather from the 1958 novel of the same
        name by Ian Fleming. The film was produced by Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli, a partnership that
        continued until 1975.</p>

    <h3>From Russia with Love (1963)</h3>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ad/From_Russia_with_Love_–_UK_cinema_poster.jpg" alt="">
    <p>The second in the James Bond series produced by Eon Productions, as well as Sean Connery's second role as MI6
        agent 007 James Bond. The picture was directed by Terence Young, produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry
        Saltzman, and written by Richard Maibaum and Johanna Harwood, based on Ian Fleming's 1957 novel From Russia,
        with Love. In the film, Bond is sent to assist in the defection of Soviet consulate clerk Tatiana Romanova in
        Turkey, where SPECTRE plans to avenge Bond's killing of Dr. No. The film followed Dr. No (1962) and was followed
        by Goldfinger (1964).</p>

    <h3>Goldfinger (1964)</h3>
    <img src="img/Goldfinger_-_UK_cinema_poster.jpg" alt="">
    <p>The third instalment in the James Bond series produced by Eon Productions, starring Sean Connery as the fictional
        MI6 agent James Bond. It is based on the 1959 novel of the same name by Ian Fleming. The film also stars Honor
        Blackman as Pussy Galore and Gert Fröbe as the title character Auric Goldfinger, along with Shirley Eaton as the
        ill-fated Jill Masterson. Goldfinger was produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman and was the first of
        four Bond films directed by Guy Hamilton.</p>

    <img src="img/Thunderball_-_UK_cinema_poster.jpg" alt="">
    <p>The fourth in the James Bond series produced by Eon Productions, starring Sean Connery as the fictional MI6 agent
        James Bond. It is an adaptation of the 1961 novel of the same name by Ian Fleming, which in turn was based on an
        original screenplay by Jack Whittingham devised from a story conceived by Kevin McClory, Whittingham, and
        Fleming. It was the third and final Bond film to be directed by Terence Young, with its screenplay by Richard
        Maibaum and John Hopkins.</p>

    <p>The fifth in the James Bond series produced by Eon Productions, starring Sean Connery as the fictional MI6 agent
        James Bond. It is the first Bond film to be directed by Lewis Gilbert, who later directed the 1977 film The Spy
        Who Loved Me and the 1979 film Moonraker, both starring Roger Moore. The screenplay of You Only Live Twice was
        written by Roald Dahl, and loosely based on Ian Fleming's 1964 novel of the same name. It is the first James
        Bond film to discard most of Fleming's plot, using only a few characters and locations from the book as the
        background for an entirely new story.</p>

    <img src="img/On_Her_Majesty's_Secret_Service_-_UK_cinema_poster.jpg" alt="">

        Following Sean Connery's decision to retire from the role after You Only Live Twice, Eon selected George
        Lazenby, a model with no prior acting credits, to play the part of James Bond. During filming, Lazenby announced
        that he would play the role of Bond only once. Sean Connery returned to portray James Bond in 1971's Diamonds
        Are Forever.</p>

    <h3>Diamonds Are Forever (1971)</h3>

        role in On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969). The film is based on Ian Fleming's 1956 novel of the same name
        and is the second of four James Bond films directed by Guy Hamilton. The story has Bond impersonating a diamond
        smuggler to infiltrate a smuggling ring and soon uncovering a plot by his old enemy Ernst Stavro Blofeld to use
        the diamonds to build a space-based laser weapon. Bond has to battle his enemy for one last time to stop the
        smuggling and stall Blofeld's plan of destroying Washington, D.C. and extorting the world with nuclear

        Saltzman, while Tom Mankiewicz wrote the script. Although the producers had approached Sean Connery to return

        same name, the film has Bond sent after the Solex Agitator, a breakthrough technological solution to
        contemporary energy shortages, while facing the assassin Francisco Scaramanga, the "Man with the Golden Gun".
