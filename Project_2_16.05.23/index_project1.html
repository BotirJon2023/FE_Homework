            it the European Union's most populous city, according to population within city limits. One of Germany's
            sixteen
            constituent states, Berlin is surrounded by the State of Brandenburg and contiguous with Potsdam,
            Brandenburg's
            capital. Berlin's urban area, which has a population of around 4.5 million, is the second most populous
            urban
            area in Germany after the Ruhr. The Berlin-Brandenburg capital region has around 6.2 million inhabitants and
            is

        <p>Paris is the capital and most populous city of France, with an official estimated population of 2,102,650
            residents as of 1 January 2023 in an area of more than 105 km² (41 sq mi), making it the fourth-most
            populated
            city in the European Union as well as the 30th most densely populated city in the world in 2022. Since the
            17th
            century, Paris has been one of the world's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, fashion,
            gastronomy,
            and science. For its leading role in the arts and sciences, as well as its early and extensive system of
            street
            lighting, in the 19th century, it became known as "the City of Light". Like London, prior to the Second
            World
            War, it was also sometimes called the capital of the world.</p>

            City of Rome, and a special comune named Comune di Roma Capitale. With 2,860,009 residents in 1,285 km2
            (496.1 sq mi), Rome is the country's most populated comune and the third most populous city in the European
            Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome, with a population of 4,355,725
            residents, is the most populous metropolitan city in Italy. Its metropolitan area is the third-most populous
            within Italy. Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio
            (Latium), along the shores of the Tiber. Vatican City (the smallest country in the world) is an independent
            country inside the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city. Rome is
            often referred to as the City of Seven Hills due to its geographic location, and also as the "Eternal City".
            Rome is generally considered to be the "cradle of Western civilization and Christian culture", and the
            centre of the Catholic Church.</p>
